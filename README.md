# Node Practice Template

This is a practice template - mostly for server side technologies. Everything will run from the server - there is no need for a separate front end. 

The 'front end' in this example is contained inside the public folder and served by including `app.use(express.static('public'))`. It will accept vanilla JavaScript and can be used to create basic components.

## Running Instructions
To run, use the following:

```bash
npm start
```

&nbsp;

## Development
For server side code, add to `server.js` inside the server folder.

For client side code, add to the `index.js` file inside the public folder.
